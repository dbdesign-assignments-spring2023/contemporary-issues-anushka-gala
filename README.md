# Two different views on how to deal with and improve data quality

In this assignment, I will be summarising and discussing my thoughts on the information in two articles (from Harvard Business Review and Forbes) about different ways in which the authors propose that we should deal with/ensure improved data quality and credibility.

## Discussion of the Harvard Business Review article

[The Article Link](https://hbr.org/2013/12/datas-credibility-problem)

In this Article, the author states that it is not that difficult to improve data quality if we enforce better communication between the people who create the data and the people who are the end users and switch the duty to ensure good quality data to business managers who have most at stake and thus, would go above and beyond to ensure better quality data.

Talking about the first idea, the author states that when the end user of the data spots a mistake while using the data, they usually try and work around it or correct the error they found by themselves. The author wants instead that we partner up with the creators of the data to get to the root of the issue of the bad data quality and avoid the same in the future.

Talking about the second idea, the author states that the issue of bad quality data arises when the creators of the data are not a part of the same organisation (or department) as the data users. He calls for senior most leadership to take charge for data quality (as they have most at stake: they face dissatified consumers and bad press, they have to explain poor results to shareholders, etc) and not delegate it to IT for example who have little at stake if the data is of bad quality.

## Discussion of the Forbes article

[The Article Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/10/01/the-age-of-analytics-and-the-importance-of-data-quality/?sh=38674d345c3c)

In this Article, the author identifies WDI or web data integration as the best way to ensure improved quality of data. WDI is a process that aggregates and normalises the data and makes the data intuitive. Additionally, they recommend to 1) move all data to a centralised database, 2) ensure that every employee is aware of all aspects of the data, well trained on data entry, management, etc, 3) create data management hierarchies so the quality is ensured even if multiple people are working on it, 4) and finally, assigning certain team members to handle data management.

Thus, I think both authors have offered us varying views on how to improve data quality and hence, ensure well-informed decision making and finally, success of the business. I think that the second article focuses more on general, easy to implement ideas for better data management while the first article, also being longer in size, identifies some creativeways to improve data quality also while giving the reader some solid real life examples.
